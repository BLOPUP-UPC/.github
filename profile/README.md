# BLOPUP - Blood Pressure Under Pressure

Welcome to the home page for the BLOPUP project. Here you can find user documentation for the app and the tech stack.

## What is BLOPUP?
BLOPUP is a collaboration between [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/ca), [Salut Sense Sostre](https://salutsensesostre.org/) and [Thoughtworks](https://thoughtworks.com)

The objective of this collaboration is to fight against High Blood Pressure, which as of today is the most common health risk factor on the planet. Due to its asymptomatic nature, the only way to detect and cure High Blood Pressure is through proactive screening.

Most people are fortunate enough to have easy access to the healthcare infrastructure required to perform this screening for themselves and their loved ones. BLOPUP comes in to provide that access to people to everyone else: disadvantaged, socially marginalized and homeless individuals that are either not in the official health system or do not have the financial means to help themselves.

## Tech Stuff
**Coming soon**

### Architecture
BLOPUP is comprised of an Android native application built with ___ and a backend running [OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org/). The mobile app is used as a companion for nurses performing visits, to record patient data and track its evolution over time. The backend is a tool for doctors to review individual patient data and potentially edit it, based on their expertise.
