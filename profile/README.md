# BLOPUP - Blood Pressure Under Pressure

Welcome to the home page for the BLOPUP project. Here you can find user documentation for the project, the app and the tech stack.

## What is Blopup?
Blopup is a collaboration between [UPC - Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/ca), [Salut Sense Sostre](https://salutsensesostre.org/) and [Thoughtworks](https://thoughtworks.com)

The objective of this collaboration is to fight against high blood pressure (HBP), which as of today is the most widespread health risk factor on the planet. Due to its asymptomatic nature, the only way to detect and treat HBP is through proactive screening. Consistent screening increases the chances of interening and maintaining HBP at reasonable levels.

Most people are fortunate enough to have easy access to the healthcare infrastructure required to perform this screening for themselves and their loved ones. Blopup aims to provide that access to everyone else: disadvantaged, socially marginalized and homeless individuals that are either not in the official health system or do not have the financial means to help themselves.

The project is entirely run by volunteers that offer their skills and their time to this cause.

## The Software
Blopup exists to gather patient data as screenings happen, where a mobile app can record patient data through a mix of connected bluetooth devices and manual input.
